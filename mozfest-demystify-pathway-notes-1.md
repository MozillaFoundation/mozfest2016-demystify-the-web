##Suggested Pathways, Ranges of Activities, & Supporting Issues

Please comment or submit issues to discuss the pathways themselves and feel free to edit copy and add activities for each pathway. I am capping my intial suggestions at 5-8 issues per pathway to make sure there's room for others to share the connections they see between proposals.

Keep in mind that we are defining pathways before we accept proposals. We should also add a localization space or replace a pathway below with localization. Also, it may be that we don't accept every supporting ticket listed below.


###The People's Street Fair: Digital Inclusion on the Web

**Range:** These sessions address local issues we can learn from as a global network of leaders supporting one another to solve problems of digital inclusion, user privacy, web literacy, decentralization, and open innovation on the net. Discussions and workshops call on participants' diverse experiences to map and engage with issues, spaces, and outcomes enmeshed in our communities.
